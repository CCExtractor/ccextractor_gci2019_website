          <h3 class="pagesMainH3">We are glad to hear that! In order to maximize your chances of winning, here are things you should know about us.<sup>*</sup></h3><br />
          <p class="pagesMainPara">
            This is going to be another absolutely amazing GCI year! We have a long and proud history of taking part in the Google Summer of Code with university students, and are excited to participate in GCI again for 3rd year with pre-university students! We have tasks that are: fun, useful, educationalâ€¦ and for all levels and interests - coding, design, documentation, UI, research and much more!<br /><br />
            While it is completely optional, it is highly recommended that you join our Slack group. All the mentors, org admins, contributors and fellow GCI participants hang out in that group. That's the best place to get quick answers to any query or problem you might have. Go to the end of this page to invite yourself to the group.<hr />
            <sub>Can't join the Slack group? It's no problem! We try to be super fast to respond to all comments and submissions in the GCI website. If you prefer email, you can email us at code-in@ccextractor.org. There's also a mailing list/Google group for CCExtractor : <a class="pagesLinks" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ccextractor-dev">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ccextractor-dev</a> if that's how you sail!</sub>

                        <strong>Perks</strong><br />
                        Remember that the absolute best way to get invited by an organization to participate in Google Summer of Code is by being part of the community before GSoC is even announced. If we, as an organization, are invited to GSoC 2019 the applications from successful Code-in students will go to the top of pile. <br /><br />
                        We also give back to our students in any way we can, including writing recommendation letters that can help to apply to universities, visas, jobs and so on.<br />
                        <strong>In short </strong>- don't think that the reward for participating this year may be limited to a t-shirt <i class="far fa-smile-wink"></i>
